I've ended up building this site using the default Jekyll theme [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
On the face of it,  Minima is a fairly boring theme.

But I got hopelessly lost trying to modify the complex and visually appealing options.

And it was taking me away from actually publishing any content.

Not to mention actually working on said content.

### So how did I do it ?

Coming soon!

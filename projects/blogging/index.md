I thought it my be a good idea to track the progress of my various software projects.

Mainly as I am notoriously bad at documentation
But also give me a way to track my progress.  
Or lack thereof.   

After checking out the various bogging options available ( and being a little frustrated by the limitations of the turnkey options such as [Google Sites](https://sitdes.google.com/) I stumbled across [GitHub Pages.](https://pages.github.com/)

Not withstanding the fact that it is free, I was intrigued by the ability to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), an open source static site generator created especially with blogging in mind.  

There is a large developer community that has built some very visually appealing templates or "themes" on top of Jekyll.

Samples of these can be found at [Jekyllthemes.io](https://jekyllthemes.io)

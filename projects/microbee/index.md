Back in distant past,  my family owned a Microbee. 

The Microbee was an Australian designed and manufactured home computer ( by a company called Applied Technology ).

Based on a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_bus">S-100</a> subsystems designed by Applied Technology,  the Microbee was released in 1982, originally as a kit and later as fully assembled models.

It sold particularly well in the educational market, both in Australia and Scandinavia.

Although only 70,000 units were shipped throughout the 1980's,  the Microbee had an outsize impact on the Australian personal computer scene.

As with most other home computer manufacturer's of the time,  the advent of IBM PC compatibles proved a death-knell for the company.
[Microbee Technology](https://microbeetechnology.com.au "Microbee Technology") is the current owner of the brand and has been actively developing new models of the Microbee.

#### Specifications, scmeshifications

The Microbee was driven by a Z80A CPU @ 3.375Mhz and came with a relatively generous 16 or 32 Kb of RAM.

Further the memory was static, allowing the Microbee to preserve memory state even after power-off ( thanks to an inbuilt battery )

BASIC was installed in ROM and used audio cassettes to store programs and data.
You could optionally have a word processor ( Wordbee ) and editor/assembler ( EDASM ) in ROM as well. 

Later models included floppy disk drives as well as upgrades to 64 or 128 Kb to facilitate running CP/M 2.2.

The Microbee was distinct from it's competitors in having a relatively high resolution video output ( 64x16/80x24 characters or 512x256 pixels ).

This was counterbalanced by rather poor sound capability ( 1 channel audio similar to that of the ZX Spectrum ).  
And the hi-res video mode was only partially bit-mapped due to a lack of screen RAM.

#### Funway into Emulation

I spent many happy hours messing about with it before time marched on and I ( and everyone else ) moved onto PC compatibles.

But I have always had a soft spot for the 'Bee.

Then, about 10 years ago, I came across an emulator called uBee512.
It was a blast running all the old software again but nostalgia will always lose out to young children in competition to your limited free time.

Then, a couple of years ago, I stumbled across it again. The challenge this time is that it couldn't be run natively under macOS.  Running it under a virtual machine was all well and good but as uBee512 was originally built for Unix,  I decided to that it couldn't be that hard to build a macOS version.  After all,  macOS has a Unix-like architecture at core.

Famous last words indeed.  I spent many months trying to build the source code ( learning a fair bit along the way ) before eventually getting something to work.

Drunk on my extremely modest triumph,  I then had the harebrained idea to build a native MacOS version, partly as a way to get back into programming and partly to prove that I could.

Even after all this time,  there are still online communities dedicated to the Microbee.

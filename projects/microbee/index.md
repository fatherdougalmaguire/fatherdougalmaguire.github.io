Back in distant past,  my family owned a Microbee.

The Microbee was an Australian designed and manufactured home computer ( by a company called Applied Technology, later known as Microbee Systems ).

Based on a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_bus">S-100</a> subsystems designed by Applied Technology,  the Microbee was released in 1982, originally as a kit and later as fully assembled models.

It sold particularly well in the educational market, both in Australia and Scandinavia.

Although only 70,000 units were shipped throughout the 1980's,  the Microbee had an outsize impact on the Australian personal computer scene.

#### Specifications, scmeshifications

The Microbee was driven by a Z80A CPU @ 3.375Mhz and came with a relatively generous 16 or 32 Kb of RAM.

Further the memory was static, allowing the Microbee to preserve memory state even after power-off ( thanks to an inbuilt battery )

BASIC was installed in ROM and used audio cassettes to store programs and data.
You could optionally have a word processor ( Wordbee ) and editor/assembler ( EDASM ) in ROM as well. 

Later models included floppy disk drives as well as upgrades to 64 or 128 Kb to facilitate running CP/M 2.2.

The Microbee was distinct from it's competitors in having a relatively high resolution video output ( 64x16/80x24 characters or 512x256 pixels ).

This was counterbalanced by rather poor monophonic speaker output ( compared to competitors such as the C64 )

And the hi-res video mode was only partially bit-mapped due to a lack of screen RAM.

#### Funway into Emulation

I spent many happy hours messing about with it before time marched on and I ( and everyone else ) moved onto PC compatibles.

But I have always had a soft spot for the 'Bee.

A couple of years ago, I came across a truly excellent PC-based emulator called [uBee512](https://www.microbee-mspp.org/repository/ "Microbee Software Preservation Project Repository").

It was a blast running all the old software on my shiny new Mac hardware.

However,  there wasn't a build available for MacOS so I had to run it under a VM.

I spent many hours trying to build the source code under MacOS and eventually I succeeded.

I then had the harebrained idea to build a native MacOS version, partly as a way to get back into programming and partly to prove that I could.

These pages will document my progress on this (foolhardy) enterprise.

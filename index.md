As a teenager, I spent a lot of my free time mucking about with the [family's home computer](microbee).   

I built a bunch of cool things ( since lost to the ages )

Life ( as it is want to do ) takes you different places and coding fell by the way side.

In recent times,  I have wanted to pick up the baton again and get my head around how things have changed.

A few projects have been bubbling around in my mind and I wanted to document what I will be doing so thing don't ( once again ) fall down the back of the metaphorical couch.

I thought about a YouTube channel.  
And then a podcast.  
I quickly came to my senses and decided that a blog might be the way to go.

These pages will attempt to track my journey into this new world.

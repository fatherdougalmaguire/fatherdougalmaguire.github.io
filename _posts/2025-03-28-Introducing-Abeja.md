I only ever found a handful of emulators built for the Microbee and none were targeted at MacOS.  
So I decided to roll my own

My implementation is called [Abeja](https://github.com/fatherdougalmaguire/Abeja "Abeja GitHub repository")

It is written for MacOS Sonoma ( v14.0+ ) using Swift/SwiftUI.

<p>Currently it doesnâ€™t do a real lot.</p>

<p>Whilst text display output works, only 1/3 of the Z80 instruction set is emulated.</p>

<p>And neither sound nor data storage functionality is present.</p>

<p>Subsequent posts will document how to got to this poin.</p>

<p>And the challenges in moving forward to a fully working implementation.</p>]]></content><author><name>Tony Sanchez</name></author><category term="Microbee" /><category term="Z80" /><category term="Emulation" /><category term="Retro Computing" /><category term="MacOS" /><category term="Swift" /><category term="SwiftUI" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only ever found a handful of emulators built for the Microbee and none were targeted at MacOS.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is there LifeOnMars ?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/03/27/Is-there-LifeOnMars.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is there LifeOnMars ?" /><published>2025-03-27T00:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2025-03-27T00:00:00+11:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/03/27/Is-there-LifeOnMars</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/03/27/Is-there-LifeOnMars.html"><![CDATA[<p>I had made abortive attempts at building MARS enviroments for the <a href="\microbee">Microbee</a> ( and later the PC ) but nothing ever came to fruition.</p>

<p>It is more of a UI framework at this point but it will serve as a testbed for code patterns required for my other project ( <a href="\abeja">Abeja</a> )</p>]]></content><author><name>Tony Sanchez</name></author><category term="CoreWars" /><category term="Redcode" /><category term="MARS" /><category term="Warriors" /><category term="MacOS" /><category term="Swift" /><category term="SwiftUI" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had made abortive attempts at building MARS enviroments for the Microbee ( and later the PC ) but nothing ever came to fruition.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting started with Minima and GitHub pages</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/03/26/Minima-theme.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting started with Minima and GitHub pages" /><published>2025-03-26T00:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2025-03-26T00:00:00+11:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/03/26/Minima-theme</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/03/26/Minima-theme.html"><![CDATA[<p>On the face of it,  Minima is a fairly boring theme.</p>

<p>But I got hopelessly lost trying to modify the complex and visually appealing options.</p>

<p>And it was taking me away from actually publishing any content.</p>

<p>Not to mention actually working on said content.</p>

A Metal shader is used to write output to the screenHowever :  Only 1/3 of the Z80 instruction set is currently emulated.  So the CPU emulation quickly goes pear shaped  No I/O functionality has been emulated. So there is no sound/keyboard/data storage as of yet.  It’s particularly slow.Subsequent posts will document how to got to this point.And the challenges in moving forward to a fully working implementation."

I built a bunch of cool things ( since lost to the ages )  Life ( as it is want to do ) takes you different places and coding fell by the way side.  In recent times,  I have wanted to pick up the baton again and get my head around how things have changed.  A few projects have been bubbling around in my mind and I wanted to document what I will be doing so things don&#39;t ( once again ) fall down the back of the metaphorical couch.  I thought about a YouTube channel.  And then a podcast.  Recognising that I would be terrible at either of these options, I quickly came to my senses and decided that a blog might be the way to go.  These pages will attempt to track my journey into this new world.  I&#39;m concentrating on three main projects at the moment.\tMicrobee - Revisiting a computer from my youth by way of a emulator.\tCorewars - Programs battle for supremacy inside a virtual computer. \tBlogging - Using Jekyll to build my own blog.Latest Posts"

      "content"  :  "Photo credit : WikipediaBack in distant past,  my family owned a Microbee.The Microbee was an Australian designed and manufactured home computer ( by a company called Applied Technology ), popular during the 1980’s.It sold particularly well in the educational market.Initially supplied as a kit ( and later as fully assembled models ),  it driven by a Z80 CPU and came with a relatively generous 16 or 32 Kb of ram.BASIC was installed in ROM and used audio cassettes to store programs and data.Later models included floppy disk drives as well as upgrades to 64 or 128 Kb to facilitate running CP/M 2.2.The Microbee was distinct from it’s competitors in having a relatively high resolution video output ( 64x16/80x24 characters or 512x256 pixels ).This was counterbalanced by lack of colour.  And the hi-res video mode was only partially bit-mapped due to a lack of screen RAM.Plus there was a rather poor monophonic speaker output ( compared to competitors such as the C64 )I spent many happy hours messing about with it before time marched on and I ( and everyone else ) moved onto PC compatibles.But I have always had a soft spot for the ‘Bee.I came across a truly excellent PC-based emulator called uBee512.I spent many hours trying to build the source code under MacOS.Whilst eventually successful, it lead me to wonder whether or not I could build my own emulator.So I have started on this massive undertaking and documenting my progress.Further information can be found at :  Wikipedia  Microbee Software Preservation Project  Microbee Technology Forum  Microbee Users Group"

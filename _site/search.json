A Metal shader is used to write output to the screenHowever :  Only 1/3 of the Z80 instruction set is currently emulated.  So the CPU emulation quickly goes pear shaped  No I/O functionality has been emulated. So there is no sound/keyboard/data storage as of yet.  It’s particularly slow.Subsequent posts will document how to got to this point.And the challenges in moving forward to a fully working implementation."

      "content"  :  "Photo credit: Daniele FranchiAs a teenager, I spent a lot of my free time mucking about with the family&#39;s home computer. I built a bunch of cool things ( since lost to the ages ) Life ( as it is want to do ) takes you different places and coding fell by the way side. In recent times,  I have wanted to pick up the baton again and get my head around how things have changed. A few projects have been bubbling around in my mind and I wanted to document what I will be doing so things don&#39;t ( once again ) fall down the back of the metaphorical couch. I thought about a YouTube channel.  And then a podcast.   Recognising that I would be terrible at either of these options, I quickly came to my senses and decided that a blog might be the way to go. These pages will attempt to track my journey into this new world. I&#39;m concentrating on three main projects at the moment:     Microbee  Revisiting a computer from my youth by way of a emulator.    Corewars  Programs battle for supremacy inside a virtual computer.    Blogging  Using Jekyll to build my own blog.Latest Posts"

      "content"  :  "I thought it my be a good idea to track the progress of my various software projects by way of a blog.Mainly as I am notoriously bad at documentation.But also give me a way to track my progress.Or lack thereof.This then begs the questions:  How do you build a blog ?  Where to host it ?  How much will it cost ?Given that this is a vanity project,cost became the prime consideration.After all, zero dollar options were the easiest to justify to my nearest and dearest.So it then becane a decision on whether I went with a turnkey solution like Google Sites, start from scratch or find some happy medium in-between.I became somewhat frustrated with Google Sites as I couldn’t style it the way I wanted ( notwithstanding I had access to an unused instance just hanging around) .Starting from scratch seemed to be a fool’s errand.I didn’t know one end of a CSS from another and the last time I created a web page, the BLINK{ tag was de rigueur.Then I stumbled across my goldilocks solution.A static site generator (SSG).For those not familar with the term, an SSG takes fixed textual content, applies an HTML template to it and generates web pages.The resultant pages are uploaded to a hosting site and bob’s your uncle, you have a blog.And because you can choose different HTML templates, you can achieve a multiplicity of output styles without having to know much about web design.My software projects use GitHub to host their source code.As part of a GitHub account, I have access to GitHub Pages.You get one site aligned to your GitHub username ( known as a “user site” ) and any number of subsidary sites ( known as “project sites” )And a number of SSG solutions are supported.I chose Jekyll as my starting point as it seem to have the largest user community.And GitHub Pages supports Jekyll out of the box.As much as I dislike the phrase “journey”, as I build out my blog, I’ll post some explanation of what I did along the way in the hope it may be of use to someone.Or a cautionary tale of being sucked into the futzing swamp."

      "content"  :  "Photo credit : WikipediaBack in distant past,  my family owned a Microbee.The Microbee was an Australian designed and manufactured home computer ( by a company called Applied Technology ), popular during the 1980’s. Here is a promotional video of the era.It sold particularly well in the educational market.Initially supplied as a kit ( and later as fully assembled models ),  it driven by a Z80 CPU and came with a relatively generous 16 or 32 Kb of ram.BASIC was installed in ROM and used audio cassettes to store programs and data.Later models included floppy disk drives as well as upgrades to 64 or 128 Kb to facilitate running CP/M 2.2.The Microbee was distinct from it’s competitors in having a relatively high resolution video output ( 64x16/80x24 characters or 512x256 pixels ).This was counterbalanced by lack of colour.  And the hi-res video mode was only partially bit-mapped due to a lack of screen RAM.Plus there was a rather poor monophonic speaker output ( compared to competitors such as the C64 )I spent many happy hours messing about with it before time marched on and I ( and everyone else ) moved onto PC compatibles.But I have always had a soft spot for the ‘Bee.I came across a truly excellent PC-based emulator called uBee512.I spent many hours trying to build the source code under MacOS.Whilst eventually successful, it lead me to wonder whether or not I could build my own emulator.So I have started on this massive undertaking and documenting my progress.Further information can be found at :  Wikipedia  Microbee Software Preservation Project  Microbee Technology Forum  Microbee Users Group"

      "content"  :  "Photo credit : WikipediaI first read about CoreWars in old back issues of Scientific American.And I was hooked.CoreWars pits two programs ( written in simplified programming language called RedCode ) against each other in a virtual computer ( called MARS or Memory Array Redcode Simulator )Each program battles each other in attempt to stop the other executing and essentially win the battle.Within this framework, these programs ( or warriors ) need to rely on complex strategies to defeat their opponents.Further,  genetic programming can be used to evolve warriors without human intervention.I decided to roll my own MARS environment as my second major project.Further information can be found at :  Wikipedia  Core War - the Ultimate Programming Game"

A Metal shader is used to write output to the screenHowever :  Only 1/3 of the Z80 instruction set is currently emulated.  So the CPU emulation quickly goes pear shaped  No I/O functionality has been emulated. So there is no sound/keyboard/data storage as of yet.  It’s particularly slow.Subsequent posts will document how to got to this point.And the challenges in moving forward to a fully working implementation."

      "content"  :  "Photo credit: Richard HorvathAs a teenager, I spent a lot of my free time mucking about with the family&#39;s home computer. I built a bunch of cool things ( since lost to the ages ) Life ( as it is want to do ) takes you different places and coding fell by the way side. In recent times,  I have wanted to pick up the baton again and get my head around how things have changed. A few projects have been bubbling around in my mind and I wanted to document what I will be doing so things don&#39;t ( once again ) fall down the back of the metaphorical couch. I thought about a YouTube channel.  And then a podcast.   Recognising that I would be terrible at either of these options, I quickly came to my senses and decided that a blog might be the way to go. These pages will attempt to track my journey into this new world. I&#39;m concentrating on three main projects at the moment:                                                                 Microbee                                                    Revisiting a computer from my youth by way of a emulator.

      "content"  :  "I thought it my be a good idea to track the progress of my various software projects by way of a blog.Mainly as I am notoriously bad at documentation.But also give me a way to track my progress.Or lack thereof.This then begs the questions:  How do you build a blog ?  Where to host it ?  How much will it cost ?Questions, Questions, QuestionsGiven that this is a vanity project,cost became the prime consideration.After all, zero dollar options were the easiest to justify to the good lady data manager her indoors.So it then becane a decision on whether I went with a turnkey solution like Google Sites, start from scratch or find some happy medium in-between.I became somewhat frustrated with Google Sites as I couldn’t style it the way I wanted ( notwithstanding I had access to an unused instance just hanging around) .Starting from scratch seemed to be a fool’s errand.I didn’t know one end of a CSS from another and the last time I created a web page, the BLINK tag was de rigueur.Then I stumbled across my goldilocks solution.Static Site GeneratorsFor those not familar with the term, a static site generator (SSG) takes fixed textual content, applies an HTML template to it and generates web pages.The resultant pages are uploaded to a hosting site and bob’s your uncle, you have a blog.And because you can choose different HTML templates, you can achieve a multiplicity of output styles without having to know much about web design.I chose Jekyll as my starting point as it seem to have the largest user community.But there are a number of different options out there:  Hugo  Eleventy  Next.jsamongst othersMein HostMy software projects use GitHub to host their source code.As part of a GitHub account, I have access to GitHub Pages.You get one site aligned to your GitHub username ( known as a “user site” ) and any number of subsidary sites ( known as “project sites” ).And GitHub Pages supports Jekyll out of the box.As with SSG’s, there are other hosting alternatives out there ( i.e. Netlify)As much as I dislike the phrase “journey”, as I build out my blog, I’ll post some explanation of what I did along the way in the hope it may be of use to someone.Or a cautionary tale of being sucked into the futzing swamp."

      "content"  :  "Back in distant past,  my family owned a Microbee.The Microbee was an Australian designed and manufactured home computer ( by a company called Applied Technology, later known as Microbee Systems ).Based on a number of S-100 subsystems designed by Applied Technology,  the Microbee was released in 1982, originally as a kit and later as fully assembled models.It sold particularly well in the educational market, both in Australa and Scandinavia.Around 70,000 units were made across the 1980’s Here is a promotional video of the era.Specifications, scmeshificationsThe Microbee was driven by a Z80 CPU @ 3.375Mhz and came with a relatively generous 16 or 32 Kb of RAM.Further the memory was static ram,  allowing the Microbee to preserve memory state even after power-off ( thanks to an inbuilt battery )BASIC was installed in ROM and used audio cassettes to store programs and data.You could optionally have a word processor ( Wordbee ) and editor/assembler ( EDASM ) in ROM as well.Later models included floppy disk drives as well as upgrades to 64 or 128 Kb to facilitate running CP/M 2.2.The Microbee was distinct from it’s competitors in having a relatively high resolution video output ( 64x16/80x24 characters or 512x256 pixels ).This was counterbalanced by rather poor monophonic speaker output ( compared to competitors such as the C64 )And the hi-res video mode was only partially bit-mapped due to a lack of screen RAM.Funway into EmulationI spent many happy hours messing about with it before time marched on and I ( and everyone else ) moved onto PC compatibles.But I have always had a soft spot for the ‘Bee.A couple of years ago, I came across a truly excellent PC-based emulator called uBee512.It was a blast running all the old software on my shiny new Mac hardware.However,  there wasn’t a build available for MacOS so I had to run it under a VM.I spent many hours trying to build the source code under MacOS and eventually I succeeded.I then had the harebrained idea to build a native MacOS version, partly as a way to get back into programming and partly to prove that I could.These pages will document my progress on this (foolhardy) enterprise.On the links  Wikipedia  Microbee Software Preservation Project  Microbee Technology Forum  Microbee Users Group  Project Granny Smith"

      "content"  :  "I first read about CoreWars back when I was at university.( I was avoiding studying for a physics exam by reading old back issues of Scientific American )And I was hooked.CoreWars pits two programs ( written in simplified programming language called RedCode ) against each other in a virtual machine ( called MARS or Memory Array Redcode Simulator )Photo credit : WikipediaLet the battle commenceEach program ( or warrior ) takes turn in executing their code in a circular memory space or core ( when you reach the end of the core,  executing wraps around to the start ).The program that executes the NOP instruction is deemed the loser,Redcode itself closely resembles assembly language.The code below is a particularly famous Redcode warrior called an ImpMOV 0, 1An Imp simply copies itself one instruction ahead in the virtual machine ( using relative addressing )And when it gets to that instruction, it copies itself again.  And so on.A more complex warrior is known as a DwarfADD #4, 3        MOV 2, @2JMP -2DAT #0, #0I won’t delve into the details of a Dwarf but essentially it writes a NOP every 4 address spaces,  ‘bombing’ the core and hopefully eliminating the opponent.Within this framework, these programs need to rely on complex strategies to defeat their opponents.Further,  genetic programming can be used to evolve warriors without human intervention.Again,  I found that there were a dearth of MacOS based MARS environments.So I decided to roll my own as my second major project.On the links  Wikipedia  Core War - the Ultimate Programming Game"

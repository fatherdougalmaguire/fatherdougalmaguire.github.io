      "content"  :  "I only ever found a handful of emulators built for the Microbee and none were targeted at MacOS.So I decided to roll my ownMy implementation is called AbejaWhich is Spanish for bee ( a nod to my heritage ).It is written for MacOS Sonoma ( v14.0+ ) using Swift/SwiftUI.Currently state of play :  It will attempt to start executing the BASIC interpreter in ROM  It will show the contents of memory and registers during execution  It show show a disassembly of the executing code  You can step through executing code.  A Metal shader is used to write output to the screenHowever :  Only 1/3 of the Z80 instruction set is currently emulated.  So the CPU emulation quickly goes pear shaped  No I/O functionality has been emulated. So there is no sound/keyboard/data storage as of yet.  Itâ€™s particularly slow.Subsequent posts will document how to got to this point.And the challenges in moving forward to a fully working implementation."
